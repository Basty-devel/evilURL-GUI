**An educational security tool that demonstrates how Internationalized Domain Name (IDN) homograph attacks work by substituting Latin characters with visually similar non-Latin characters from Cyrillic and Greek scripts. This tool helps security professionals, developers, and educators understand and defend against homograph attacks.**

## üöÄ Features

- **Character Substitution**: Expands Latin characters to visually similar Cyrillic and Greek homoglyphs
- **Professional GUI**: Modern PyQt6 interface for interactive exploration
- **Domain Analysis**: Performs WHOIS lookups to check domain registration status
- **Online Verification**: Checks if generated domains are resolvable via DNS
- **Punycode Display**: Shows ASCII representation of internationalized domain names
- **Security Checks**: Comprehensive analysis with color-coded risk indicators
- **Educational Focus**: Detailed explanations of homograph attacks and security implications

## üõ† Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)

### Steps

1. **Clone or download this repository**
   ```bash
   git clone github.com/Basty-devel/evilURL4.git
   cd evilURL4
Create a virtual environment (recommended)


# Create virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv homograph_env
```
# Activate on Windows
```bash
homograph_env\Scripts\activate
```
# Activate on macOS/Linux
```bash
source homograph_env/bin/activate
```
# Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
# üìñ Usage
Graphical Interface (Recommended)
```bash
python evilURL4.py
```
Enter a domain name in the input field (e.g., "example.com")

Select character sets to use (Cyrillic, Greek, or both)

Choose analysis options (WHOIS lookup, online checks)

Click "Analyze Domain" to generate homograph variations

View results in the table with color-coded status indicators

Double-click any result to see detailed domain information

Command Line Interface
```bash
python evilURL4.py example.com
```
The CLI mode provides text-based output of homograph variants with basic security checks.

# üîç Technical Details
How It Works
The tool identifies characters in domain names that have visually similar equivalents in other scripts (primarily Cyrillic and Greek). It generates all possible combinations of substitutions and performs various security checks:

Punycode Conversion: Translates international characters to ASCII-compatible encoding

WHOIS Lookup: Checks domain registration status and displays details

Online Verification: Attempts to resolve domains to identify active homograph attacks

Risk Assessment: Color-coded indicators show potential security risks

# Character Substitution Map
The tool uses a carefully curated mapping of Latin characters to their visually similar non-Latin equivalents:

Latin	Cyrillic	Greek	Description
a	–∞	Œ±	Cyrillic small a, Greek alpha
c	—Å		Cyrillic small es
e	–µ		Cyrillic small ie
o	–æ	Œø	Cyrillic small o, Greek omicron
p	—Ä		Cyrillic small er
x	—Ö	œá	Cyrillic small ha, Greek chi
y	—É	Œ≥	Cyrillic small u, Greek gamma
See the complete mapping in the source code.
